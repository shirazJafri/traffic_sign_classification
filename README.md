# Traffic Signs Classification
In this project, we will train deep learning models known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify 43 traffic sign images. This project could be practically applied to self-driving cars.

In this project we will perform the following tasks: 
* Import libraries and datasets 
* Images visualization 
* Convert images to gray-scale and perform normalization 
* Build deep learning model 
* Compile and train deep learning model 
* Assess trained model performance
